# Example: Dynamic simulation of OMIB branch trip
# This example runs a dynamic simulation of the OMIB System with a Branch Trip perturbation. 
# It is copied directly from the NREL-Sienna Documentation: "Quick Start Guide for PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl"

# Build a system (i.e. network model) from Sienna's built-in library.

# Define the perturbation you are interested in modeling.

# Define the time span of the simulation

# Create the simulation object. This step includes initialization of the system. 
# This means that it first finds a stable equilibrium point to which the disturbance is applied.
# [More info about initialization](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl/stable/initialization/)
sim = Simulation!(ResidualModel, omib_sys, pwd(), time_span, perturbation_trip)

# (Optional) Explore the initial condition (i.e. stable equilibirum point) that was found.
# These are the values at t=0 (pre-disturbance) of all state variables in the system

# (Optional) Perform small-signal analysis (this has a binary output, i.e. stable or not-stable)
small_sig = small_signal_analysis(sim)

# (Optional) Print small-signal analysis results (if stable, all of the real parts are negative)

# NOTE: This is the first time our perturbation_trip variable is used
# NOTE: IDA() is a differential-algebraic equation solver
